    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p>
        Howl’s Moving Castle is one of <strong><em> my favorite Ghibli films</em></strong> and 
       the breakfast scene with calcifer is probably one of the 
       most popular food scenes out of all the Ghibli films, or even 
       anime in general. 
    </p>

    <p>
       While it’s a very simple Western breakfast, 
       it just looks so darn good while they’re cooking and eating it.</p>
    </p>


    <h3>Ingredients, you will need</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>3 slices thick cut bacon</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 loaf bread</li>
        <li>1 slab cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step by Step, How to cook it</h3>

         <ol>
                 <li>Heat a large pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <hr>
                <li>Add 3 slices of bacon to the pan and cook until crispy. Push them to one side of the pan.</li>
            <hr>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Crack 4 eggs directly into the pan next to the bacon. Cook until sunny side up eggs are to your preference.</li>
            <hr>
                <li>Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <hr>
                <li>Cut desired amount off from the loaf of bread.</li>
            <hr>
                <li>Serve the bacon, eggs, bread, and cheese family-style.</li>
        </ol>    

    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>

        <p>
            I think most Western households will have all of these
            items already at home. But the most important thing 
            to note is the BACON.
