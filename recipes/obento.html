    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p>
        Totoro is one of the most iconic Ghibli films and is loved all across
         the world. It was one of my favorite movies growing up so it definitely 
        holds a special and nostalgic place in my heart. Probably the most iconic
        food in Totoro was the corn, but this bento comes in at a close second.

        Probably you are asking yourself, <strong><em>What´s a bento (弁当)?</em></strong>. Bento
        most easily explained, is a Japanese boxed lunch. It is a single-portion
        meal (usually home-packed or take-out) with a variety of ingredients 
        (like fish, meat, pickles, and/or vegetables) that is usually paired with
        rice.
        Bento is a very big part of Japanese culture and has been around since
        the 1100s. Many parents provide their kids with bento to take to school
        and it’s almost a social expectation for mothers to make bento that is not
        only healthy and nutritionally balanced, but aesthetically pleasing too.

    <h3>Equipment</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Bento Box (弁当箱)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ingredients, you will need</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 umeboshi (梅干)</li>
        <li>1 shishamo (柳葉魚)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 handful frozen edamame</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sakura denbu</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step by Step, How to cook it</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Put cooked rice in your bento box about 3/4 of the way full (leave some room at the top for your toppings and to be able to put the lid on).</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Take 1 umeboshi and put it on one side of the rice.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>In a small pan, heat the oil on medium-high. Cook one shishamo on both sides until cooked.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Place the cooked shishamo across the middle of the bento box on the rice.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Boil water in a small pot. Put in a handful of frozen edamame and cook according to package instructions.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Once cooked, pop the edamame beans out of the pod. Arrange them on the rice to fill up a little less than one quarter of the bento box, under the shishamo.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Sprinkle the sakura denbu on the rice next to the edamame.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Enjoy whenever it's lunch time! Put a lid on it and pack it away to take with you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>

    <p>
        I hope you were able to get all the ingredients. 
        Mastering this "art" has taken many years for the 
        mothers of Japan, be patient and enjoy the process.
